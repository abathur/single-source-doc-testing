"""
This is a hopefully-temporary placeholder to help inch down
3 separate tracks:
- single-sourcing resholve's ~documentation
- automating parts of resholve's source and documentation to
  pull from the single-source above
- modularizing resholve's codebase

A few phases:
1. collect strings here and swap their use sites
2. replace this file with an output generated from strings.py.in
    - I already have all of the pieces for this, but I need to figure out how the active component involving j2cli works (the makefile is outside of a nix build, and I don't have j2cli installed systemwide; I either need to fold this in a nix build, or provide the command with nix-run, or use a shebang, or something...)
3. idk?
